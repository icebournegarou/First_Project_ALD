Contains scripts and diagrams for Ansible and Linux

This contains a PDF file which documents the ansible files used during setup.  These three playbooks are my first playbook, ELK server set up, and an additional one for a Filebeats set up.  From there there are multiple Linux set up scripts to include for loops and a server set up with security.  Finally we have the diagrams for both an ELK server and a basic virtual network set up with a load balancer included.

The diagrams are also saved as PDF's for viewing.  On the diagrams the IP address for all virtual machines and networks have been included though the personal IP has been omitted as this changes based on the use.
